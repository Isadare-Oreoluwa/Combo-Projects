# ðŸ§  SQL â€“ Advanced Analysis

## Purpose  
SQL was used to perform structured, in-depth analysis of the dataset, focusing on trends, comparisons, and economic efficiency over time.

## Key Queries  
- Monthly and yearly profit and sales trends  
- Gross profit margin by product and segment  
- Month-on-month % changes in:
  - Sales  
  - Profit  
  - COGS per unit vs Revenue per unit  
- Product profit and sales contribution breakdown

## Optimizations  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions were used for clean, efficient querying  
- Designed to scale with larger datasets

## Insights Gained  
- Sales and profit moved in a similar pattern
- The COGS per unit was stable at around 0 with very few distortions  
- The Product Paeso had high revenue but unimpressive margins
- Each product's Contribution to sales was similar to their contribution to profits
