# ðŸ“ˆ Sales Performance Analysis Project

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing sales data across various products, countries, and customer segments. Using a multi-tool approach, I conducted comprehensive analysis in **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to derive insights into profitability, cost efficiency, and revenue trends.

## Tools Used  
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial exploratory analysis  
- **SQL**: Advanced data analysis (e.g., time trends, aggregations, profit contribution)  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  

## Key Questions Explored  
- Which products and countries contribute most to profit and revenue?  
- How does discounting affect sales and profit?  
- Are there patterns in cost and revenue per unit over time?  
- What are the segment-level profit margins and trends?

## Insights Summary  
- Discounts have a strong positive correlation with sales (0.74) and a moderate one with profit (0.44).  
- Paeso leads in sales volume but shows only average profit margin, pointing to cost inefficiencies.  
- COGS per unit remains stable over time; fluctuations in gross profit margin are driven by changes in revenue.  
- Gross profit margins vary more by segment than by product, suggesting pricing/cost structure differences.
