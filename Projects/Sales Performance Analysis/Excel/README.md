# ðŸ“Š Excel â€“ Data Cleaning and Initial Analysis

## Purpose  
Excel was used for initial exploration of the raw dataset. This included formatting, cleaning, and deriving new columns like profit margin, COGS per unit, and revenue per unit.

## Key Steps  
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Created calculated fields (e.g., gross profit margin, unit-level metrics)
- Used Correlation Analysis to determine discount impact on performance
- Built pivot tables to explore:
  - Total sales and profit by product and country
  - Segment-level performance
  - Month-wise units sold and revenue

## Insights Gained    
- The range in the contribution of countries to profit is just over $3.9m showing that they all contributed almost equally
- Some segments have high revenue but poor profit margins, highlighting inefficiencies
- Discounts strongly influenced sales volume but had a weaker influemce on profitability
